            title: "Additional Items",
            description: "While making online purchases, users may find additional items added to their cart. Often, this is done surreptitiously in the hope that the user will complete the sale before the additional items are discovered. Other times, this is presented as a convenience, with related or popular items added to save the shopper time and help them discover new products.\\n The process usually follows one of several practices: a checkbox or radio button on a prior page may be selected, adding specific items to the cart with the user’s un-informed agreement; items may be automatically added to the cart with misleading notices implying the items are suggestions, obfuscating their addition to the purchase; in rare cases, additional items are not displayed until the review step of the checkout process, with the expectation that the user will either miss the new items or be unwilling to go back and edit their order."

            title: "Confirm-shaming",
            description: "Using language to elicit feelings of guilt or shame in users attempting to leave, cancel, or decline a service. Rather than using positive language to guide users towards a desired outcome, confirm-shaming uses negative language to make users feel bad for choosing an unwanted outcome.\\n Examples often involve a putting words in the users’ mouths, such as “No thanks, I already know enough about…” or “No thanks, I don’t like savings”. While simple to implement, this method can be very effective, especially when utilized by non-profit, charitable, or other mission-driven organizations."

            title: "Deceptive Timers",
            description: "Online retailers can create a false sense of scarcity around their products, encouraging shoppers to make their purchases swiftly and impulsively. These timers often take two forms—a litter countdown timer and an inventory tally.\\n Countdown timers are used to indicate a sale or price reduction with a clearly delineated expiration and are usually deployed site-wide. But rather than being linked to a real limited-time offering, the “sale” runs indefinitely, with indicators displaying a pseudo-random remaining time. This time limit is usually short enough to inspire quick action, but long enough that a user has time to browse and complete checkout. The false timer is sometimes paired with artificially enhanced prices that are then “discounted” to appear on sale.\\n Inventory tallies are used on a per-item basis, displaying a finite number of remaining stock. This is often accompanied by a call to action, urging users to buy before items sell out. But the number remaining is entirely disconnected from actual inventory, simply displaying a random integer."

            title: "Disguised Ads",
            description: "Advertisements can be disguised as content or navigation in order to engender more clicks and interactions from users. By disguising these ads, users engage with paid content, often traveling to entirely different sites without their knowledge.\\n Common examples include ads injected into search results with minimal visual differentiation and false download buttons on free software sites."

            title: "Forced Continuity",
            description: "Websites and services collect payment information when users sign up for free trials. When the trial ends, the payment method is automatically billed as the user’s subscription is converted to a paid plan. In some cases, payments are incurred without notification, reliant on the known fact that most people rarely check their credit charges. In some instances, payment details are not required by the process but careful UX design is used to mislead users into providing the information anyway."

            title: "Opt-Ins",
            description: "One method of encouraging users to make choices they might not otherwise select is to pre-select those options. Users do not always read through all of the checkboxes presented to them, so some websites opt users in to these programs and features. Declining after the fact often involves traversing intricate settings menus or navigating a trammel-net-like process. Opt-Ins are usually oriented around data sharing or digital marketing."

            title: "Switched Answers",
            description: "When navigating a longer series of menu screens, users become habituated to the location and features of navigation buttons. Switching the positions of Yes and No buttons on a later page may trick users into agreeing when they mean to decline. Users tend to get impatient while navigating long menus, and will click through sections that disinterest them quickly. Hurried users are unlikely to notice the switch, and will attempt to decline but actually agree."

            title: "Trammel Net",
            description: "This pattern involves placing significant obstacles in the way of a user attempting to quit or cancel a service. A trammel net (otherwise referred to as a roach motel) is a sort of trap that is easy to enter but difficult/impossible to leave. Barriers to exit involve extended cancelation processes, repeated options to alter, rather than end, a subscription, and requiring users to print, fill out, and mail in a physical form."
