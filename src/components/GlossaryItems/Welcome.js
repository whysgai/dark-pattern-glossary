            <p>Welcome to the Glossary of Dark Patterns. Dark patterns are tricks and strategies that websites use to take advantage of visitorsâ€”to sell them more things, to keep them from leaving, and to collect their data. This site shows how some of the more common patterns work. Rather than real-life examples, it uses simple, exaggerated demonstrations to call attention to what is happening and how your choices are being directed.</p>
